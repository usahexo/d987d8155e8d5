#  Festival Casino: Far from the Strip but Plenty of Funnel Cakes!

Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States. People from around the world visit Sin City to experience the bright lights and attractions of The Strip. However, there are many other great places to visit in Las Vegas that are off the beaten path. One of my favorites is Festival Casino.

Festival Casino is located east of The Strip in Henderson, Nevada. It’s not as flashy as some of the more famous casinos, but it’s definitely worth a visit. There are a number of great restaurants and bars on site, as well as a large casino floor. They also have a really big stage for concerts and other events.

One of the best things about Festival Casino is their funnel cakes. They have a stand right on the casino floor and they make some of the best funnel cakes I’ve ever had. They’re huge, fluffy, and loaded with sugar and cinnamon. If you love funnel cakes, then you need to check out Festival Casino!
