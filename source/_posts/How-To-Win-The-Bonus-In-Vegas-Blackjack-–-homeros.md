#  How To Win The Bonus In Vegas Blackjack – homeros

Las Vegas is a city that has something to offer everyone. If you are looking for a little bit of fun and excitement, you can find it in the casinos. However, if you are looking to make some money while you are there, blackjack is the game for you.

Blackjack is a game that is played with cards. There are six decks of cards in the game, and each deck has 52 cards. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer also has to try and get as close to 21 as possible, but they have to hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.

If you are playing blackjack in Las Vegas, there is a bonus that you can try and win. This bonus is called the bonus payoff, and it pays out extra money if you are able to get a blackjack. To win this bonus, you need to have an ace and a ten-value card as your first two cards. This combination is also called a natural blackjack.

If you are able to get a natural blackjack, you will be paid out 3:2 on your bet. This means that if you bet $10, you would win $15. However, if the dealer also has a blackjack, the hand is considered a push and no one wins anything.

The key to winning the bonus in Vegas blackjack is knowing when to take risks and when to fold your hand. If you have a strong hand, it might be worth risking going over 21 in order to see if the dealer also goes over 21. However, if your hand is weak, it might be better to fold and wait for another opportunity.

When playing blackjack in Las Vegas, always remember that the house edge is about 1%. This means that for every $100 that you bet, the house will keep $1 and give you back $99. However, by using basic strategy and by counting cards, you can reduce the house edge down to 0.5%. This means that for every $100 that you bet, the house will only keep $0.50 and give back $99.50.

If you want to be successful at blackjack in Las Vegas, make sure that you use basic strategy and count cards. This will help reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning some extra money while at the casino!

Be sure to ask your casino host for advice on which tables offer the best odds.

#  Homeros' Guide To Beating The House Edge In Vegas Blackjack!

When you sit down to play blackjack in Las Vegas, do you know what the house edge is? This is the amount the casino expects to make on each hand played, expressed as a percentage. For example, if the house edge is 3%, this means that for every $100 bet, the casino expects to keep $3 and give back the remaining $97.

The house edge varies depending on the game variation and can range from around 0.5% to over 15%. So it's important to choose the game with the lowest house edge for your bets. Here is a list of some of the most popular blackjack games in Vegas and their respective house edges:

Single Deck Blackjack - 0.17%
Double Deck Blackjack - 0.42%
Spanish 21 - 0.48%
Pontoon - 1.17%
Classic Blackjack - 1.58%
American Roulette - 5.26%
European Roulette - 2.70%
 Hence, if you're looking to reduce the house edge as much as possible when playing blackjack in Vegas, your best bet is Spanish 21 or Pontoon, both of which offer a house edge of less than 1%. If you're not familiar with these games, don't worry – we'll walk you through the basics below. But first, let's take a look at some basic blackjack strategy that will help minimize the house edge even further.  ### Basic Blackjack Strategy As we mentioned earlier, one of the best ways to reduce the house edge when playing blackjack is to use basic blackjack strategy. This simply involves making certain decisions based on the cards you are dealt and can dramatically decrease the casino's advantage. For example, here are some basic principles that apply when you are dealt two cards:
* If your two cards total 9 or 10 (a "natural"), stand.
* If your two cards total 11 or 12, hit . 
* If your two cards total 13-16, hit unless the dealer has an ace showing then stand .  * If your two cards total 17-21, stand .  * Double down if you have two cards totaling 10 or 11 .   These are just a few of the basic strategies you should remember when playing blackjack in Vegas – for a more comprehensive list, be sure to check out our complete guide to blackjack strategy [here](https://www.homersgamingguide.com/blackjack-strategy).  Now that we've gone over some basic tips for reducing the house edge when playing blackjack in Vegas, let's take a look at two popular variants of this game – Spanish 21 and Pontoon – and see how they compare:  ### Spanish 21 vs Pontoon As we mentioned earlier, Spanish 21 and Pontoon both have a lower house edge than traditional blackjack (around 0.5%), making them ideal choices for players looking to reduce their chances of losing money. But what exactly is different about these games compared to regular blackjack?  * In Spanish 21 , all face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are worth 10 points instead of their usual value of 11-14 points respectively . This makes it easier for players to form winning hands , as it's more likely they will have at least one card totalling 10 points . * In Pontoon , players can only double down on two card totals of 9 or 10 , whereas in regular black jack players can double down on any two card total . * The deck in Pontoon consists of only 48 cards (Aces through 6s), compared to 52 cards in a standard deck . This gives players less opportunity to make high-value hands , as there are fewer 4s, 5s and 6s in the deck . So which game should you choose – Spanish 21 or Pontoon? The answer largely depends on personal preference – if you prefer having more opportunities to form winning hands , go with Spanish 21 ; but if you prefer having fewer potential high-value hands , go with Pontoon . Whichever game you choose , using basic blackjack strategy will give you the best chance of beating the house edge!
