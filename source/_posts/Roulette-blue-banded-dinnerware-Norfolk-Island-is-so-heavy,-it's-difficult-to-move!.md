Norfolk Island is an Australian territory in the Pacific Ocean. It's so heavy, it's difficult to move! The island is made of a basaltic rock, which makes it quite heavy. In fact, it's so dense that it's one of the heaviest places on Earth!

The island was first discovered by Captain James Cook in 1774. He named it after the Duke of Norfolk. The island was later settled by British convicts in the late 1700s. The convicts were used to build roads and other infrastructure on the island.
