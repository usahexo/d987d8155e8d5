#  Team PokerStars dominates Tampa Bay Buccaneers poker tournament!

Team PokerStars, led by Chris Moneymaker and Bertrand "ElkY" Grospellier, absolutely demolished the Tampa Bay Buccaneers poker tournament, winning almost every pot and taking home the $50,000 first prize!

With nearly 30 players in the tournament, Moneymaker and ElkY quickly established themselves as the two biggest stacks at the table. And while they did battle against each other on a few occasions, for the most part they let everyone else fight it out amongst themselves.

The final hand of the night came when Moneymaker raised to 180 from middle position and ElkY called from the big blind. The flop came 8♥4♦3♣ and ElkY check-called a Moneymaker bet of 240. The turn was the 2♣ and ElkY check-called another bet of 360 from Moneymaker. The river was the J♥ and ElkY finally moved all in for 1,440. Moneymaker snap-called with A♠J♠ for trip jacks, while ElkY turned over K♥Q♦ for two pair. With that, Team PokerStars had won another prestigious poker tournament!
