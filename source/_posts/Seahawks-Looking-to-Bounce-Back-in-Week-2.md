#  Seahawks Looking to Bounce Back in Week 2

The Seahawks looked sloppy in their loss to the Broncos in Week 1. They turned the ball over three times and were unable to generate much of a pass rush. However, they are still a very talented team and should be able to bounce back against the Bears in Week 2.

The Seahawks have one of the best defenses in the NFL. They led the league in scoring defense last year and should be able to shut down the Bears' offense. The Seahawks also have a potent passing attack, led by Russell Wilson. Doug Baldwin is one of the best receivers in the NFL and should be able to exploit Chicago's secondary.

The Bears are a decent team, but they are not on Seattle's level. The Seahawks should be able to win this game easily.

#  Seattle Seahawks: Betting Favorites Against the 49ers

The Seattle Seahawks come into Week 7 as 3.5-point favorites against the San Francisco 49ers, according to OddsShark.

This comes as no surprise, as the Seahawks have been one of the best teams in the NFL this season. They are currently 4-1 and have looked impressive in most of their games.

The 49ers, on the other hand, have been one of the worst teams in the NFL. They are currently 1-5 and have looked terrible in most of their games.

There is a good chance that the Seahawks will win this game by a wide margin. The 49ers simply donâ€™t have enough talent on their roster to compete with Seattle.

#  Line Moving Toward Seahawks in Las Vegas

It's a well-known fact that the NFL is the most popular sports league in the United States. It is also a well-known fact that Americans love betting on sporting events. This brings us to the current situation with the Oakland Raiders relocating to Las Vegas.

There has been a lot of talk about which team will be moving to Las Vegas to fill the now vacant spot of the Raiders. One of the leading contenders is the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks make sense for several reasons: they are a team with a following in California (where Las Vegas is located), they are an established team with a winning record, and they have a strong fan base.

If the Seahawks were to relocate to Las Vegas, it would be huge news not only in Sin City, but all around the country. The move would bring big business to Las Vegas and would no doubt increase tourism to the city. It would also create excitement for fans of the Seahawks who would now have a chance to see their team play live in person.

#  Seahawks-49ers Point Spread: Don't Count Out Jimmy G and Co. Just Yet

The San Francisco 49ers will enter their Week 3 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks as 3.5-point underdogs, but that doesn't mean they can't pull off the upset.

Led by quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, the 49ers have shown plenty of promise early in the season. In two games, Garoppolo has thrown for 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions while completing 71.4% of his passes.

The Seahawks, meanwhile, looked sluggish in their season-opening defeat to the Denver Broncos and struggled again in last week's win over the Chicago Bears. If Garoppolo can continue playing at a high level, there's no reason why the 49ers can't surprise Seattle on Sunday.

#  NFL Week 2 Betting Lines: Seattle a Near-Locking Pick Over San Francisco

The NFL Week 2 betting lines are out, and Seattle is a near-lock pick over San Francisco.

The Seahawks opened as 8.5-point favorites and, according to the latest odds from BetOnline, that line has not moved since. The 49ers, meanwhile, have seen their odds of winning this game jump from +290 to +350.

Seattle is coming off a convincing 24-13 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 1. The 49ers, on the other hand, lost 28-18 at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo struggled in his team's season opener, completing just 15 of 33 passes for 261 yards and one touchdown against two interceptions. Receiver Marquise Goodwin was the only San Francisco player to record more than 50 yards receiving in that game (86 yards on four catches).

Meanwhile, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson had a solid outing in Week 1, completing 22 of 26 passes for 236 yards and two touchdowns. The Seahawks' run game was also effective against Detroit, with Chris Carson rushing for 102 yards on 20 carries.

San Francisco's defense did force three turnovers against Tampa Bay, but it still looks like a major step down from Seattle's unit. The Seahawks allowed just 16 points per game last season (second best in the NFL) while the 49ers gave up 25 points per game in 2017 (19th in the league).

Given these factors, it's hard to see San Francisco pulling off the upset win on Sunday. Seattle should cruise to an easy victory.
