#  Rams Gamble on GoffEarly in First Round

The Los Angeles Rams traded up from the 15th overall pick to the number one overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft to select quarterback Jared Goff.

Critics argue that the Rams gave up too much to select Goff, as they gave the Tennessee Titans two first-round picks and a third-round pick. However, the Rams believe that Goff is their franchise quarterback and are confident in his ability to be successful in the NFL.

Goff played college football at California and was a three-year starter. He threw for 12,279 yards and 96 touchdowns during his college career.

Despite his success in college, Goff is not without his flaws. His mechanics need some work and he will need to improve his decision making. However, new Rams head coach Sean McVay is confident that he can coach Goff up and help him reach his potential.

McVay was the offensive coordinator for the Washington Redskins last season and helped Kirk Cousins become one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL. He is expected to do the same for Goff.

The Rams offense was one of the worst in the NFL last season. They ranked dead last in points scored and 31st in total yards. They hope that Goff can help turn things around and make them a competitive team again.

Goff will have a lot of pressure on him from day one, but he is ready for it. "I'm very confident," Goff said about being the number one overall pick. "I'm excited for this opportunity. I can't wait to get started."

#  Rams Hope Improved Offense Leads to More Wins

The Los Angeles Rams’ offense was one of the worst in the NFL last year. They hope that with some offseason improvements, they can have more success this season.

One of the biggest changes on the Rams offense will be at quarterback. Jared Goff is now the starter after being drafted first overall in 2016. He struggled as a rookie, but the Rams believe that he has talent and can improve with more experience.

Another change on the Rams offense will be at running back. Last year’s starter, Todd Gurley, is now joined by Lance Dunbar, who was signed as a free agent from Dallas. Dunbar is a smaller back who can catch passes out of the backfield, which should help take some pressure off of Gurley.

The Rams also made some changes to their receiving corps. The most notable addition is former Titans receiver Tavon Austin, who was acquired in a trade. Austin is a speedy player who can make big plays when given the opportunity.

Despite these offseason changes, there are still some concerns about the Rams’ offense. Goff has limited experience and may not be ready to lead an NFL team yet. The offensive line was also one of the worst in the NFL last year and needs to be improved if the Rams want to have any success.

If everything goes according to plan, however, the Rams should be able to improve upon their 4-12 record from last year and compete for a playoff spot in 2017.

#  Gurley Ready to be a Feature Back

The Los Angeles Rams backfield is crowded with Todd Gurley, Malcolm Brown, and Tavon Austin all vying for touches. However, Gurley is ready to be the feature back.

In an interview with ESPN's Alden Gonzalez, Gurley said: "I'm a running back. I want the ball in my hands as much as possible. I don't care who's out there. I'm still going to try to get the ball."

Gurley also spoke about his love of the game and how he's been working hard this offseason to improve his game. "I just love football so much," he said. "I've been working on my patience and my lateral movements and trying to stay low."

The Rams have been impressed with Gurley's work ethic and are looking forward to seeing him in action this season. "He loves football," head coach Jeff Fisher said of Gurley. "He was very diligent in his rehab. He did everything he was supposed to do."

With a crowded backfield, it will be interesting to see how the playing time is divided up this season. However, Gurley is clearly ready to be the feature back and should see plenty of touches throughout the year.

#  Rams Sign TE Kendricks to New Contract

The LA Rams announced they have signed TE Lance Kendricks to a four-year contract extension.

Kendricks, 27, was originally drafted by the Rams in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He has played his entire career with the Rams and has been a key member of their offense.

Kendricks has been a productive player for the Rams, totaling 2,512 yards and 20 touchdowns on 236 receptions. He had his best season in 2016 when he caught 52 passes for 481 yards and four touchdowns.

The Rams have one of the best young offenses in the NFL and Kendricks is a key part of that. With Jared Goff, Todd Gurley, and others in the fold, Kendricks will continue to be a major factor in the Rams’ success.

This is a great move by the Rams and it should help them continue to build an impressive offense.

#  Watkins, Woods Could Be Lethal Receiving Duo

 * First-year Denver Broncos head coach Vance Joseph isn't hiding the fact that he envisions receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders as his No. 1 and 2 targets this season.

That may come as a surprise to some, considering that fellow wideouts Bennie Fowler III, Cody Latimer and Carlos Henderson are all returning from last year's team.

"Demaryius is our No. 1; Emmanuel is our No. 2," Joseph said Monday, according to ESPN's Jeff Legwold. "No question about that."

* Watkins, Woods Could Be Lethal Receiving Duo | Bleacher Report 

Los Angeles Rams wide receivers Sammy Watkins and Robert Woods could prove to be a lethal duo for quarterback Jared Goff this season.

Watkins was acquired from the Buffalo Bills in a trade this offseason, while Woods signed a five-year, $34 million contract with the Rams in free agency.

"We're very excited about those two additions," Rams head coach Sean McVay said of Watkins and Woods on Tuesday, according to Myles Simmons of the team's official website. "They bring a lot of different skillsets to our offense."

Woods had 91 receptions for 1,024 yards and six touchdowns last season with the Bills, while Watkins had 59 receptions for 882 yards and six touchdowns.
