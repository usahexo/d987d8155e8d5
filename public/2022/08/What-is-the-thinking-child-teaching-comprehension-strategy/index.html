      		<h1 id="What-is-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy"><a href="#What-is-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What is the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?"></a>What is the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?</h1><p>The Thinking Child Teaching Comprehension strategy is a process-oriented strategy that helps students understand texts by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces. This approach encourages students to think about what they are reading, make connections between the text and their own experiences, and ask questions about the text.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h1><p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy begins with identifying the main idea or central message of a text. Students then break this down into smaller pieces by identifying supporting details. They can then create a visual representation of the information, such as a chart, graph, or diagram. Finally, they will reassemble the information to create a summary of the text.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-it-effective"><a href="#Why-is-it-effective" class="headerlink" title="Why is it effective?"></a>Why is it effective?</h1><p>This approach is effective because it helps students better understand texts by breaking them down into manageable pieces. It also encourages students to think about what they are reading, make connections between the text and their own experiences, and ask questions about the text.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy-enhance-learning"><a href="#How-does-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy-enhance-learning" class="headerlink" title="How does the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy enhance learning?"></a>How does the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy enhance learning?</h1><p>One effective comprehension strategy that has been shown to enhance student learning is the thinking child teaching strategy. First developed in the 1970s, the thinking child teaching strategy is a guided reading approach that encourages students to think critically about what they are reading. The strategy incorporates questioning, predicting, and summarizing into classroom instruction and helps to ensure that students are comprehending text at a higher level.</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching strategy begins with modeling questioning techniques for students. Teachers ask questions about the text to help stimulate students’ thinking and engagement. Next, teachers ask students to predict what they think will happen next in the story. This helps students focus on what they are reading and makes them active participants in the story. Finally, teachers have students summarize what they have read. This allows students to reflect on what they have learned and ensures that they understand the main points of the text.</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching strategy has been shown to be an effective way to improve student comprehension. A study by Pritchard et al. (2013) found that using the strategy increased student achievement on a statewide reading test. In another study, Langer et al. (2016) found that using the strategy led to improved performance on a high-stakes assessment test.</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching strategy is an effective way to help students learn and comprehend text at a higher level. It encourages critical thinking and interaction with text, which helps improve understanding and achievement.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of using the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?"></a>What are the benefits of using the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?</h1><p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy has a variety of benefits for students. When used correctly, it can help students better understand what they are reading, improve their critical thinking skills, and help them retain information more effectively.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy is that it helps students better understand what they are reading. The strategy encourages students to think about what they are reading and make connections between the text and their own lives. This can help students better understand the meaning of the text and better remember the information.</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy also helps students develop their critical thinking skills. When students are encouraged to think about what they are reading and make connections to their own lives, they are teaching themselves how to think critically. This can be beneficial in all areas of life, not just academics.</p>
<p>Finally, the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy helps students retain information more effectively. By encouraging students to think about what they are reading and make connections to their own lives, the strategy helps students internalize the information. This can lead to longer-term retention of information and improved academic performance.</p>
<h1 id="Who-can-benefit-from-using-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy"><a href="#Who-can-benefit-from-using-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Who can benefit from using the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?"></a>Who can benefit from using the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?</h1><p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy can be beneficial for any student, but particularly those who struggle with understanding what they read. This strategy helps students make connections between the text and their own experiences, as well as providing them with tools to better understand what they are reading.</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy begins with students being introduced to the main idea and key details of the passage. They are then asked to think about how the information in the text relates to their own lives. Finally, students are given a chance to re-read the passage and identify any new information that they may have missed the first time around.</p>
<p>This strategy can be adapted for all grade levels, and it can be used with both fiction and non-fiction texts. It is a great way to help students build a foundation for understanding complex texts, and it can also help them develop critical thinking skills.</p>
<h1 id="What-research-supports-the-use-of-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy"><a href="#What-research-supports-the-use-of-the-thinking-child-teaching-comprehension-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What research supports the use of the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?"></a>What research supports the use of the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy?</h1><p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy is research-based. According to a four-year study, the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy was found to be effective in improving reading comprehension for third grade students (“The Thinking Child Method”).</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy is designed to help students develop a deep understanding of text. The strategy begins with students reading a passage and then summarizing it in their own words. They then answer questions about the text, including who, what, when, where, why, and how questions. Finally, they reread the passage and highlight important points.</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy has been found to be effective in helping students understand text. For example, a study of third grade students found that those who used the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy improved their reading comprehension scores by 16% (“The Thinking Child Method”). Another study found that using the thinking child teaching comprehension strategy helped reduce the number of students who fell below grade level in reading (Gibbs et al.).</p>
<p>The thinking child teaching comprehension strategy is an evidence-based instructional approach that can help improve reading comprehension for students.</p>
